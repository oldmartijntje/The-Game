WELCOME TO THIS README

i am honoured to know that u played my game.

info:
at any point (where it is waiting for an input) u can say "options" to change the settings
remove the DLC.activ file to play the original game
add a file named DLC.activ to the folder if you have deleted it, it doesn't need data inside of it
